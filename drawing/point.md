下面介绍如何使用"XY 点位文件"功能，帮助您快速生成所需的 DXF 文件。

## 1. 参数说明

### 1.1 点位文件地址
- **作用**：指定包含 XY 点位数据的文本文件路径。
- **设置建议**：点击右侧"选择文件"按钮，选择本地的点位数据文件（如 `shape.txt`）。

### 1.2 XY 数据索引号
- **作用**：指定点位数据在文件中的每一行提取第几列数据，第一个数据索引为 0。
- **设置建议**：输入数字（如 `56`），表示提取第 56 列数据。

### 1.3 交换 XY 数据
- **作用**：是否将 X、Y 坐标数据互换。
- **设置建议**：点击下拉菜单，选择"是"或"否"。一般情况下选择"否"，如有特殊需求可选择"是"。

### 1.4 保存文件
- **作用**：指定生成的 DXF 文件保存路径。
- **设置建议**：点击右侧"选择文件"按钮，选择或输入保存的文件路径（如 `output.dxf`）。

## 2. 注意事项
- 点位文件需为标准文本格式，内容应包含有效的 XY 坐标数据。
- 索引号应为正整数，确保数据读取正确。
- 若生成失败，请检查文件路径、数据格式及参数设置建议是否正确。
